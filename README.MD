WhatsApp Number Validation Script

This script automates the validation of WhatsApp numbers using WhatsApp Web via Selenium WebDriver. It checks each number and saves the results in an output file, indicating whether each number is valid or invalid.

Steps to Use

1. Create a Virtual Environment:
   To avoid version conflicts, create and activate a virtual environment by running:
   ```
   python -m venv your_venv_name
   ```
   
2. Activate the Virtual Environment:
   On Windows, activate the virtual environment by running:
   ```
   .\your_venv_name\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
3. Install Dependencies:
   Use `pip` to install the required packages from `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
4. Prepare Your Input File:
   Create an input file in CSV format with a column named `Number`, containing the phone numbers you want to validate. Save it as `input.csv` in the same directory as the script.

5. Run the Script:
   Start the validation process by running the script with the following command:
   ```
   python newupdation.py
   ```

6. Check the Output:
   After running, the script will generate an `output.csv` file containing two columns:
   - `Number`: The phone number checked.
   - `Status`: Either "valid" or "invalid" based on the check result.
